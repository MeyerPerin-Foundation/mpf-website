<article data-clarity-region="article">

In the beginning of 2024, I have been [diagnosed with ADHD](2024-01-04-adhd.qmd). Since then, I started [treatment with medicine and therapy](2024-01-19-adhd-treatment.qmd). I have also written a [4-week update on my progress](2024-02-10-adhd-treatment-4-week.qmd) and I plan to continue documenting it. 

Over time, I [acquired a few technologies](2024-02-02-adhd-coping-technologies.qmd) and developed a few strategies to cope with ADHD. 

They are listed below, and I plan to keep updating them as I find new ways to deal with ADHD, mostly through therapy.

## Multiple open projects
 
As counterintuitive as it may seem, I usually have multiple projects going on at the same time. The way this works is that when I'm working on a project and get distracted, the distraction usually comes from another project (like an email or a meeting), so I switch to that project. This way, I'm still being productive.

## Log activities as I start them

 I got the habit (or routine) of logging most activities as I start executing them. This helps me when I eventually get distracted, because I can go back to the log and see what I was doing before I got distracted. I use Siri and Microsoft To-Do to log activities, as described in the [Coping Technologies](#coping-technologies) section.

## Plan activities I don't want to start 

I learned this technique recently. When I realize that I haven't been productive and my day is a "bad day", instead of trying to concentrate and do more, I go into planning mode. I essentially give up trying to do things, I start just planning and preparing things. If I'm trying to download 100 images and keep getting distracted, I would instead just list the websites that I want to download the images from, create the the Azure storage to receive it, etc. I may call this **productive avoidance**.
